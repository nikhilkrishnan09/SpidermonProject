WorldText.txt is the file for creating object within the game/playable area
Each new object requires its own line in the text file, with no spaces in between

Syntax for creating a new object is as follows:

ObjectName x y

Where x and y are the coordinates, and each value is separated by a space

ObjectNames:
newTree - renders a tree
newGobby - renders a villain (just the image so far)
newHouse - renders a house
newBuilding - renders a building
